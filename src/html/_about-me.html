    <p class="aboutMe__content-text">
      The last year I devoted myself to training and developing my skills in IT.
      I want to start a career as a junior web developer in a company, and my
      target is to grow to a team lead in 5 years. I like creating web
      applications for users and I think that the most important thing for a
      developer is the ability to solve the task and bring the work to the end.
      <br />
      Also, I have English classes to get a B2 level and I do sports.
      <br />
      As for expectations from future work, first of all, I would like to get
      experience from more experienced developers and work in a team. And of
      course, to develop in Front-end as a developer.
