      My name is Eddie and I'm a Front-end developer.&#128522; I want to start a
      career as a junior web developer in a company, and my target is to grow to
      a team lead in 5 years.&#129504; I like creating web applications for
      users and I think that the most important thing for a developer is the
      ability to solve the task and bring the work to the end. <br />
      <br />
      As for practice, I have some pet-projects in my portfolio, where you can
      see my programming skills.&#127891; <br />
      In my projects, I used such technologies as: <br />
      - Native JavaScript / Css / API => Currency converter app <br />
      - React (State and Effects methods) / Css / API => Weather app <br />
      - React (Context method) / Redux (Toolkit) / Scss => E-Commerce shop
      website <br />
      - React / Redux (Toolkit and RTKQuery) / Scss / API => Responsive music
      app <br />
      - React (Custom hooks and context) / Redux (Toolkit and RTKQuery) /
      TypeScript / Scss / API. <br />
      <br />
      Also, I have English classes to get B2 level and I do sports.&#128170;
      <br />
      As for expectations from future work, first of all I would like to get
      experience from more experienced developers and work in a team. And of
      course, to develop in Front-end as a developer.&#128640;
